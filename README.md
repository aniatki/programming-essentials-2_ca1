A town runs a lottery for its residents. You have been asked to write a simple lottery programme for them to calculate the winnings. Here is how the lottery system works: 

A winning ticket consists of 3 different numbers between 1 and 24, and they are secretly selected. Then the lottery programme will ask a player to input 3 different numbers between 1 and 24. (NOTE, it is important that each number in the winning numbers or playerâ€™s numbers are unique). The winnings are calculated based on the following: 

| Conditions                      | Results                                               |
----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|All 3 numbers have matched       | Tell the player that she/he has won the first prize.  |
|2 numbers have matched           | Tell the player that she/he has won the second prize. |
|Only 1 number has matched        | Tell the player that she/he has won the third prize.  |
|None of the numbers have matched | Tell the player good luck next time.                  |

### This is how your programme should work:

1. Create winning ticket numbers.
  Your programme will assign randomly 3 unique numbers between 1 and 24 as the winning numbers. 
2.  Input customer name, and 3 numbers between 1 and 24. 
  Ask a customer to input 3 unique numbers between 1 and 24.
3.  Calculate the winnings.
  After the data is entered, the programme calculates the winnings and prints out the result on the screen.

###### Example: 

**Input**

```Enter the first number for your lottery ticket: 23```

```Enter the second number for your lottery ticket: 5```

```Enter the third number for your lottery ticket: 6```


**Output**

```Your lotter ticket number is: 23, 5, 6 ```

```Congratulations! You have won the first prize!``` 

a. Using either a flowchart or an algorithm for the problem. (14 marks)

b. Create two sets of test data to test your program. (6 marks)

c. Implement the algorithm in (a) above in Python. (30 marks)
